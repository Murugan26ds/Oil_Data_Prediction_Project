Data Collection: Gather historical data on oil prices and relevant factors that influence them, such as supply, demand, geopolitical events, economic indicators, etc. Sources can include financial databases, government publications, industry reports, and news sources.

Data Preprocessing:

Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Convert time-related features into appropriate formats. Normalize or scale the data if necessary. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze the statistical properties of the data. Visualize the data to identify patterns, trends, and correlations. Conduct feature engineering to create new features that may improve prediction performance. Feature Selection:

Identify the most relevant features using techniques such as correlation analysis, feature importance from models, or domain knowledge. Model Selection:

Choose appropriate models for oil price prediction. Time series forecasting models like ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA), or Prophet are commonly used. For regression-based approaches, consider models such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting machines. Training and Validation:

Split the data into training and validation sets, typically using a time-based split. Train the selected models on the training data and validate their performance on the validation set. Tune hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation or grid search to optimize model performance. Model Evaluation:

Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), or root mean squared error (RMSE) for regression models. For time series models, consider additional metrics like AIC/BIC (Akaike/Bayesian Information Criterion) or visual inspection of residual plots. Model Deployment:

Once satisfied with a model's performance, deploy it to make predictions on new data. Monitor the model's performance in production and update it as needed. Documentation and Reporting:

Document the entire process, including data sources, preprocessing steps, model selection, and evaluation results. Prepare a report summarizing the project, highlighting key findings, insights, and the performance of the predictive models. Iterative Improvement:

Continuously refine and improve the model over time as new data becomes available or as business requirements change. Consider incorporating advanced techniques such as ensemble methods, neural networks, or deep learning if needed.
